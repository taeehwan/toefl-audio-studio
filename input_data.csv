003_Narrator,"Listen to a conversation between a student and a receptionist at the Registrar’s Office on the first day of the semester.",cjVigY5qzO86Huf0OWal
004_Student,"Excuse me, I’m supposed to be having my physics class in the science building, but no one’s in the classroom. Could you tell me where the class is? Physics 403 — has it been moved?",FGY2WhTYpPnrIDTdsKH5
005_Receptionist,"Well, there’s a room assignment sheet on the bulletin board outside this office.",iP95p4xoKVk53GoZ742B
006_Student,"Yeah, I know, but my class isn’t listed there. There must be some kind of mistake or something. Could you look it up, please?",FGY2WhTYpPnrIDTdsKH5
007_Receptionist,"Hmmm... ok, let me check on the computer. It’s physics, right? Wait, did you say physics 403?",iP95p4xoKVk53GoZ742B
008_Student,"Yeah.",FGY2WhTYpPnrIDTdsKH5
009_Receptionist,"Er…I’m sorry, but it says here that it was cancelled. You should have gotten a letter from the registrar’s office about this.",iP95p4xoKVk53GoZ742B
010_Student,"What? I’ve never got it.",FGY2WhTYpPnrIDTdsKH5
011_Receptionist,"Are you sure? ‘Cause it says on the computer that the letter was sent out to students a week ago.",iP95p4xoKVk53GoZ742B
012_Student,"Really? I should have gotten it by now. I wonder if I threw it away with all the junk mail by mistake.",FGY2WhTYpPnrIDTdsKH5
013_Receptionist,"Well, it does happen. Er… let me check something. What’s your name?",iP95p4xoKVk53GoZ742B
014_Student,"Woodhouse, Laura Woodhouse.",FGY2WhTYpPnrIDTdsKH5
015_Receptionist,"Ok, hmmm…Woodhouse, let me see… ah, it says here we sent it to your apartment on er… Center Street.",iP95p4xoKVk53GoZ742B
016_Student,"Oh, that’s my old apartment. I moved out of there a little while ago.",FGY2WhTYpPnrIDTdsKH5
017_Receptionist,"Well, and I suppose you haven’t changed your mailing address at the administration office. Well, that would explain it.",iP95p4xoKVk53GoZ742B
018_Student,"Yeah, I guess that’s it. But how can they cancel the class after offering it. If I’d known this was going to happen, I would have taken it last semester.",FGY2WhTYpPnrIDTdsKH5
019_Receptionist,"I know, it’s really inconvenient for you, I understand that, but er… if we don’t have enough students signed up for the course, the college can’t offer it. You know, it’s a practical issue, like we can’t have an instructor when there’re only a few students in the class. You see what I mean?",iP95p4xoKVk53GoZ742B
020_Student,"I guess, but now I don’t know what course I should take instead.",FGY2WhTYpPnrIDTdsKH5
021_Receptionist,"Ok, let’s see. Do you have any courses you’re going to take next semester? If you do, you might want to take them now and sign up for physics 403 next semester.",iP95p4xoKVk53GoZ742B
022_Student,"Yeah, I guess I could do that. I just hope it won't be cancelled again. Do you know how many people have to be enrolled in order to keep a class from being cancelled?",FGY2WhTYpPnrIDTdsKH5
023_Receptionist,"Well, it depends on the class, but for that class, you have to have er… let’s see, usually it’d be at least ten people, but since it was cancelled this semester, they might even do it with less. But do you know what you should do? Give the physics department a call a couple of weeks before the semester starts. They’ll be able to tell you if they’re planning to go through with it. It's their decision, actually.",iP95p4xoKVk53GoZ742B
024_Student,"Oh, ok, I will do that. Thanks for the info.",FGY2WhTYpPnrIDTdsKH5
025_Receptionist,"No problem. Sorry about the class. Oh, why don’t you go change your mailing address now. It’ll only takes a minute.",iP95p4xoKVk53GoZ742B
026_Student,"Oh, oh, sure, I will do that right way.",FGY2WhTYpPnrIDTdsKH5
